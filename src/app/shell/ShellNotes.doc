                              ===================

12-Sep-94
---------

  - "SetVerbose on" is now slightly more verbose


12-Aug-94
---------

  - Supports demand-loading of non-privileged objects. This makes the shell
    the non-privileged counterpart to the operator. The shell now creates
    a message port to accept service requests from the kernel, and calls
    on the operator in non-privileged mode to perform the service.

  - The shell now uses kprintf() instead of printf() when doing screen IO.
    This speeds things up somewhat. It also makes the code smaller.


25-Jul-94
---------

  - Now knows about Naviken CDs, and will launch $RunNavikenCD when such a
    disk is detected.


06-Jul-94
---------

  - Shrank minmem code to save many bytes in RAM and ROM

  - Added memdebug.lib errors when in development mode


15-Jun-94
---------

  - ROM-over-CD changes. This involves doing better sniffing of the origin
    of the universe. The setting of $sysboot was removed as it is no longer
    needed.


21.10.785 (26-May-94)
---------------------

  - The shell now provides a mechanism to add error strings for system
    components that can't do it themselves. When in development mode, the shell
    now adds error strings for compressutils.lib, timerutils.lib, music.lib,
    and Access.


21.10.??? (25-May-94)
---------------------

  - Changed the errors that Access can return to conform to the standard
    system error scheme. The numbers were previously pretty much random.


21.10.729 (18-May-94)
---------------------

  - The UserPC value printed by the shell now really shows the user-mode PC
    of the task, instead of showing the address of where the user-mode PC
    is stored!

  - $RunNoCD is now executed if no disk is present in the drive

  - $RunVideoCD is now executed in addition to $RunPhotoCD when a non-3DO
    data CD is detected.

  - $RunUnknownCD is now executed if an unknown type of disk is currently in
    the drive.


21.10.632 (05-May-94)
---------------------

  - Substantially reduced the risk of the PS crashing. It now
    scans the task list much quicker, thus reducing the risk of
    having the list modified from under it.

  - Any shell command accepting numerical input can now handle
    $ to indicate the beginning of a hex number, in addition to
    0x.


21.10.627 (05-May-94)
---------------------

  - Reduced the size and increased the reliability of the MemMap
    command. The global task list is now searched instead of the
    separate waitQ and readyQ lists.


21.10.621 (04-May-94)
---------------------

  - Fixed some potential holes in handling of thread termination, and
    mac IO requests. This could only be a problem in development mode,
    not in production mode.


21.10.579 (02-May-94)
---------------------

  - Improved and expanded the output format of some internal commands


21.10.553 (29-Apr-94)
---------------------

  - MemMap now produces more useful output.


21.10.505 (28-Apr-94)
---------------------

  - Access is no longer part of the shell. It is now a separate
    loadable module located in $tuners/access.tuner. It is
    loaded on demand by the shell when needed, and unloaded
    immediately after.


21.10.446 (25-Apr-94)
---------------------

  - Added the new ShowError command. Give it a system error number, and
    it displays the associated error string


21.10.219 (30-Mar-94)
---------------------

  - Serial mode is now always on when using the non-development mode
    shell

  - The shell can now start threads instead of tasks. If a command-line ends
    with @, the object is loaded and executed as a thread of the shell.
    This will be used to run the eventbroker under the shell's task.

  - The shell now takes advantage of the updated LoadProgram() in the file
    system. It now tries to run files as AIFs first, and if that fails due
    to a bad file format, it then tries to run the files as scripts. This
    avoids extra useless disk access during boot up, and speeds up the
    booting process.

  - Ending a command-line with % tells the shell to explicitly run the
    object as a script, and not bother to run it as an AIF. This is used
    internally to launch the startopera script, and can be used to launch the
    AppStartup script. This again avoids extra disk access to determine if the
    file is indeed a script or an AIF.

  - "verbose on" now causes new task/thread names, items, and
    addresses to be printed.

  - Fixed bug introduced a few versions ago with KillTask() getting confused
    about not finding requested tasks.


21.10.87 (23-Mar-94)
--------------------

  - Fixed incorrect handling of scripts < 64 bytes in size


20.33.680 (17-Mar-94)
---------------------

  - If not in development mode, then the serial terminal mode is now
    enabled. This should let us pear into production units.


20.33.652 (16-Mar-94)
---------------------

  - Revamp of the shell UI. Most built-in commands now have descriptive
    names as synonyms for the more terse command names, output of commands
    has been improved and made consistent.

  - Major source code cleanup.

  - Changed access.h to not contain C++ comments.

  - Before loading an executable, the shell now calls ScavengeMem() to try and
    release as much of its memory as possible.

  - Fixed bug where multiple queued requests for Access services would
    not be handled correctly. The message port was not being drained whenever
    a signel was received.

  - The ROM version of the code is quite a bit smaller, since PrintError()
    is used throughout.

  - Raised minmem minimum.

  - Shell includes serial support.

  - Memory to hold script files is no longer allocated with MEMTYPE_STARTPAGE,
    which should avoid some fragmentation.

  - Overall memory use is reduced.

  - Bugs in the handling of nested scripts have been fixed.

  - Changed the prompt from "Mac-->" to "3DO-->"
