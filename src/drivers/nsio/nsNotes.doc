09-Nov-94
---------

  - Found and fixed the kernel bug (in firq.c) preventing
    us from using INT_PD

  - Implemented enough extra functionality for the shell to
    use this driver, verified the input functionality was OK

  - Removed the extra functionality (when we want to start
    doing line mode input, we need to do a decent design, not
    a quickie hack.)
