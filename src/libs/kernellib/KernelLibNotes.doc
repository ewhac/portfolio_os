	* Provide "SuperSendMsg" and "SuperSendSmallMsg" as analogs of
	the SendMsg and SendSmall Msg call

	* Remove "SuperPutMsg": the arg list was too short, and it
	would have encouraged putting messages out with garbage in
	them.

Mon Apr 25 10:30:00 1994  Martin Taillefer

	* Added SuperCreateMsg(), SuperCreateSmallMsg(),
	SuperCreateBufferedMsg(), SuperDeleteMsg(), SuperCreateMsgPort(),
	SuperDeleteMsgPort(), SuperFindMsgPort(), SuperCreateSemaphore(),
	SuperDeleteSemaphore(), SuperFindSemaphore()

	* Changed the pointer types for SuperControlMem(),
	SuperIsRamAddr(), and SuperValidateMem() from (char *)
	to (void *) to avoid needless casting.

Wed Feb  2 14:21:21 1994  Greg Limes  (limes@freeside)

	* Added KernelLibNotes.doc as the release notes for this
	directory.

	* Fixed folio vector number for SuperGetThisMsg

	* Added entry point SuperPutMsg
