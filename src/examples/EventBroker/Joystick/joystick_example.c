|||
|||	    Demonstrates simple interaction with the joystick using data filtering and

|||	    joystick and leaves a still of it on screen when you press the trigger.

The basic workings of the broker shell are as follows:

/* make a communications connection to the event broker */
BS_ConnectBroker();

/* listen for the devices you want */
/* events from */
BS_WatchJoyStick();

/* you can interleave Ignore and Watch calls */
/* to pay attention to whatever you want at a given */
/* time.with */
BS_IgnoreJoyStick()

/* then wait for event broker events in a cpu-friendly */
/* fashion with */
BS_NiceWaitEvent();

/* BS_NiceWaitEvent() returns a mask that lets you know */
/* which devices have received data, and if you */
/* have recieved a signal besides an event broker message signal */
/* you can get the signals you received with */
BS_GetOtherSignals();

/* the mask BS_PORT_CHANGE */
/* lets you know that there has been a change on the */
/* control port device daisy chain */
/* you can get a tally of devices with */
BS_GetPeripheralCount();

/* you can find out if you are watching a device */
/* currently and what events you are getting from it */
/* with */
BS_WatchingJoyStick();


/* with your received data you can */
/* debounce, filter, fold mutilate, */
/* and spindle it with */
BS_ProcessJoyStickData();

/* shut down the connection to the broker */
/* and free up temporary data allocations */
BS_DisconnectBroker();
