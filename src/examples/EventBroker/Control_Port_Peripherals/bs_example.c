|||	bs_example - Peripheral example program.
|||
|||	  Synopsis
|||
|||	    bs_example
|||
|||	  Description
|||
|||	    This demonstration program lets you move a cel (a cloud) around the screen
|||	    with a joystick and leave an image of it on the screen when you press the
|||	    trigger. You can also distort the cel and clear the screen. The program
|||	    supports control pad, joystick, and mouse interaction.
|||
|||	    This example illustrates how to use the broker shell peripheral
|||	    interaction utilities.
|||
|||	    The connection/configuration/disconnection routines can be used as-is in
|||	    final code.
|||
|||	    The data interaction/processing is less efficient than it could be for the
|||	    sake of modularity, comprehensibility, and flexibility. If you unpack the
|||	    BS_NiceWaitEvent() and BS_ProcessXxxData() routines and perform that
|||	    processing in a more direct way performance will improve. You should also
|||	    eliminate any debouncing checks that you don't use.

The basic workings of the broker shell are as follows:

/* make a communications connection to the event broker */
BS_ConnectBroker();

/* listen for the devices you want */
/* events from */
BS_WatchCPad(); and or
BS_WatchJoyStick(); and or
BS_WatchMouse(); and or
BS_WatchLGun(); /* NOT WORKING NOW!! */

/* you can interleave Ignore and Watch calls */
/* to pay attention to whatever you want at a given */
/* time.with  */
BS_IgnoreCPad() and BS_IgnoreLGun() and
   BS_IgnoreMouse() and BS_IgnoreJoyStick()

/* then wait for event broker events in a cpu-friendly */
/* fashion with */
BS_NiceWaitEvent();

/* BS_NiceWaitEvent() returns a mask that lets you know */
/* which devices have received data, and if you */
/* have recieved a signal besides an event broker message signal */
/* you can get the signals you received with */
BS_GetOtherSignals();

/* the mask BS_PORT_CHANGE */
/* lets you know that there has been a change on the */
/* control port device daisy chain */
/* you can get a tally of devices with */
BS_GetPeripheralCount();

/* you can find out if you are watching a device */
/* currently and what events you are getting from it */
/* with */
BS_WatchingJoyStick(); and/or
BS_WatchingCPad(); and/or
BS_WatchingMouse(); and/or
BS_WatchingLightGun();

/* with your received data you can */
/* debounce, filter, fold mutilate, */
/* and spindle it with */
BS_ProcessJoyStickData(); and or
BS_ProcessCPadData(); and or
BS_ProcessMouseData(); and or
BS_ProcessLGunData(); /* NOT WORKING!! */

/* shut down the connection to the broker */
/* and free up temporary data allocations */
BS_DisconnectBroker();
