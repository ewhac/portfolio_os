|||	tsp_algorithmic - Advanced sound player example showing algorithmic
|||	    sequencing of sound playback.
|||
|||	  Synopsis
|||
|||	    tsp_algorithmic
|||
|||	  Description
|||
|||	    Assume you have two short sounds in memory and one long sound file with
|||	    the following markers: BEGINbeginning segment (attack) Looploop segment
|||	    (sustain) First Ending1st ending segment (gap) Second Ending2nd ending
|||	    segment (release, end) END
|||
|||	    Given this, algorithmically play the following sequence of sounds: Segment
|||	    What you should hearlong sound beginning segmentattack long sound loop
|||	    segmentsustain long sound 1st ending segmentgap long sound loop segment
|||	    sustainlong sound 2nd ending segmentrelease, end short sound 1\<blast>long
|||	    sound loop segment sustain long sound 1st ending segmentgap long sound
|||	    loop segmentsustain long sound 2nd ending segmentrelease, end short sound
|||	    2\<honk>
|||
|||	    The technique used to implement this sequence involves the use of static
|||	    branches, where one segment always leads into another, (e.g. after playing
|||	    the 1st ending always go back to the loop segment), and decision functions
|||	    where a conditional branching is required (e.g. from the end of the loop
|||	    segment either go to the 1st or 2nd ending).
|||
|||	    This also demonstrates using sounds spooled from disc and played directly
|||	    from memory.
