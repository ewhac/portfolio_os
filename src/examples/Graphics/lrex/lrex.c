|||	lrex - Demonstrates subcel extraction from an image.
|||
|||	  Synopsis
|||
|||	    lrex \<imagefile>
|||
|||	  Description
|||
|||	    Demonstrates how to extract a cel from a frame buffer or bitmap image,
|||	    that can then be redrawn into the frame buffer. Can be used for things
|||	    like breaking up a static or dynamic image (like the video in Mystery
|||	    Matinee in Twisted) and reorganizing it.
|||
|||	    Subcel extraction from a frame buffer (bitmap) is slightly different from
|||	    extraction from another cel. This program handles extraction from bitmaps
|||	    only.
|||
|||	    The extraction can easily be done with the appropriate call to the Lib3DO
|||	    functions (CreateLRFormCel), but this example shows how to do it long
|||	    hand.
|||
|||	    When extracting from bitmaps, pay attention to the order in which the
|||	    pixels are represented.
|||
|||	    The program is based on animsample and aaplayer. The user can manipulate
|||	    the extracted cel.
|||
|||	  Caveats
|||
|||	    In performing the cel manipulation, the source for the cel may end up
|||	    pointing to garbage. This is especially likely if the program is
|||	    distorting the cel near the edge of the extracting bitmap.
|||
|||	  Arguments
|||
|||	    imagefile                    Name of 3DO image file.

			/*
			   Allocate some space for a ccb.  We will use this later.  The reason
			   why we want to dynamically allocate the ccb* rather than declare
			   a ccb and set a pointer to it is future compatibility.  Allocating
			   ensures where we get the memory from.  In this case, its DMA accessible
			   (very important for the cel engine).  Not doing the allocation means
			   that we can't control were the memory comes from... and in the future,
			   that might be bad (ie. the code would break)

			   Also, set all the relevant stuff for this cel to be rendered by the cel engine
			   as an LR-form cel.

			   What is LR-form, you ask?  Well, that is the name given to the arrangement of bytes
			   in a 3DO image and for the frame buffers (ie, for a bitmap).  What this means is that
			   whereas, what you see on the screen is an arrangement of pixels like so:

			   1	2	3	4	5
			   6	7	8	9	10				 (assume a 5 pixel wide screen)....

			   The pixels are arranged in memory (in the array that really is the bitmap) like so:

			   1	6	2	7	3	8	4	9	5	10

			   So, its that adjacent vertical pixels that are adjacent in memory.

			   This makes things a little weird... especially in the realm of pointer arithmetic
			   and extracting a cel from this format.... you need to tell the cel engine that the
			   source data for this cel is arranged differently from what it would normally expect.

			   Something else to keep in mind... images are pointer to ubyte's... that is 8 bits... though
			   each pixel is 16 bits....

			   This weirdness also limits what you can extract.  You can only really extract from
			   even lines of the bitmap, because the LRFORM bit only affects how the cel engine
			   displays the data in its source ptr, not the way that it grabs the data.  So for
			   instance, if I were to try to grab the odd line from the above data, I would get
			   source for the cel that looks like:

			   6  2  7  3  8... and so on.  Not exactly what you want, is it?

			   Here is where it gets confusing... finding out the address
			   of the pixel in the frame buffer or bitmap that we want the cel to start at.

			   Basically,

			   offset = (y/2) * 1280 + 4x + (y & 1) << 1

			   Reasons:

			   x identifies the pixel.  Given the LR form... in any row, a pixel at position x
			   is really at a position twice that (remember, the second row's pixels are inbetween).

			   Then, pixel 2x is at byte 4x (2x * 2) because there are 2 bytes per pixel.

			   y identifies which pixel.  For any odd y, the y is really located in the first row.
			   So y/2, tells us the row.  Then, multiply that by 2 * bitmap width gives us where
			   in the bitmap the pixel really is.

			   Multiply that by two to get the byte offset, again because each pixel is 2 bytes.

			   Yikes!

			   The last term is to adjust the offset for odd vs even lines.  For odd lines, you have
			   to move over to the next pixel (multiply by 2 for 2 bytes per pixel).  If you are
			   extracting only from the even lines, then that term drops out.  We are only extracting
			   from even lines, so this term is not included below.

			   NOTE::

			   There is also, technically, a bug here in the program.  If you take the cel,
			   flip it vertically, then you are bound to get bogus data written into the cel
			   as the cel engine tries to read stuff from memory addresses well beyond the defined
			   bitmap.  Moral of this story... try to extract stuff from valid addresses.  Normally,
			   you don't see this... the cel engine draws bogus data, but clips itself before it
			   really draws.  With strange distortions, the cel engine goes ahead and draws whatever it
			   finds in the memory specified.

			   One the other hand, if we used SetVRAMPages(), then we might have

			   Also, we might have chosen to use the Defer family of these functions

			   We draw the cel with DrawCels().  If we had multiple cels to draw,

			   This is substantially faster than calling DrawCels() on each

**
**	  Implementation
**
**
**	  Caveats
**
**	   Whoa!  Tons of stuff.  If you were doing this yourself, how would you do it?
**
**	   The idea is to try to minimize the calls to MapCel ().  Why would you want to
**	   minimize those calls?  Because MapCel() is slow.  There are 8 fields in the CCB
**	   which determine the region in which the cel engines render a cel.  MapCel() sets
**	   all 8 of those fields.  Six of those, require divides, which are slower than
**	   molasses on a cold winters day.  Most position changes for a cel don't
**	   depend on all 8 of those fields... some can stay the same... so you end up
**	   wasting a lot of time doing unnecessary math.  This is most generally the
**	   case when you are doing simple moving and scaling of the cel (ie. adding no
**	   perspective).  Most of the time, you can pretty much figure out what the
**	   ccb scaling factors are and do the math yourself.  The formulas are (given
**	   that the order of points is clockwise, starting at the upper left):
**
**	   x = x0
**	   y = y0
**	   hdx = (x1-x0)/w
**	   hdy = (y1-y0)/w
**
**	   vdx = (x3-x0)/h
**	   vdy = (y3-y0)/h
**
**	   hddx = [(x2-x3) - (x1-x0)]/wh = (hdx1-hdx0)/h
**	   hddy = [(y2-y3) - (y1-y0)]/wh = (hdy1-hdy0)/w
**
**	   where w and h are the pixel dimensions of the cel.
**
**	   Keep in mind what base the ccb fields are.  XPos, YPos, VDX, and VDY are 16.16
**	   HDX, HDY, HDDX and HDDY are 12.20.
**
**	   Secondly, there is MapP2Cel(), which works on cels whose dimensions are powers of
**	   two.  There is also FastMapCel() and InitFastMapCel() which are faster
**	   than MapCel(), but provide less precision.
