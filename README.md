# 3DO M1 Opera Portfolio OS

The 3DO M1 Opera platform ran an OS called Portfolio. For the time a quite advanced operating system which supported preemptive multitasking, dynamic code loading, supervisor/user process separation, memory fences (MMU), threading, message passing, a filesystem, high level IO abstractions, device drivers, etc. Portfolio was created to ease development on the platform but it also acted as an abstraction to the hardware so that manufacturers had more flexibility in their design and provide for compatibility with future systems (which were designed but never released to retail.)

On 2022-01-07 a snapshot of the M1 Opera's Portfolio OS from 1995-02-10 was uploaded to Archive.org by user [EagleSoft](https://archive.org/details/@eaglesoft).

## What is This Repo?

This repo is a copy of the Portfolio OS source code which was released by EagleSoft on 2022-01-07. While I wasn't responsible for the release of the Portfolio source code I was in contact with the individual who did so prior to release, run the site [3DO Development Repo](https://3dodev.com), and am the primary maintainer of the libretro 3DO emulator [Opera](https://docs.libretro.com/library/opera). This repo is in the least a GitHub hosted backup and reference but may be a starting place for future development.
