3DOBoot scripts (by default) come in three flavors: one for anvil
based systems, one for madam/clio NTSC systems (opera), and one for
madam/clio PAL systems (operauk). These differ only in which of
the dipir binaries is loaded at boot time, but the correct one
must be used.

	3DOBoot.anvil.scr	Development stations using the
				Anvil chipset (not Madam/Clio).

	3DOBoot.opera.scr	Classic devlopment stations using the
				Madam/Clio chipset (including the
				International station) in NTSC mode.

	3DOBoot.operauk.scr	Development stations using the
				Madam/Clio chipset (mainly the
				International station) in PAL mode.

It is possible to generate a 3DOBoot script that uses the Creative
variant of the dipir, but not useful.

We no longer need a separate boot script for each memory size. At boot
time, the primary operating system module (sherry) will locate the
other preloaded modules *as*if* it were on a system with 2M of DRAM,
and move the modules (if needed) to their correct locations.
